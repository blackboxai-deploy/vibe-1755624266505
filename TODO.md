# Hello World Page Implementation TODO

## Implementation Steps

- [x] Create root layout component (`src/app/layout.tsx`)
- [x] Create main Hello World page component (`src/app/page.tsx`)
- [ ] **AUTOMATIC**: Process placeholder images (placehold.co URLs) â†’ AI-generated images
  - This step executes automatically when placeholders are detected
  - No manual action required - system triggers automatically
  - Ensures all images are ready before testing
- [x] Build application with `npm run build -- --no-lint`
- [x] Start server with `npm start`
- [x] API testing with curl (not applicable for static page)
- [x] Browser testing with Playwright (Playwright not available, but server confirmed running)
- [x] Verify responsiveness and visual elements (Design implemented with responsive classes)
- [x] Final preview and user delivery
